        <b>By the Beach Park</b><br>
        (M. Blancaflor)<br><br>
        American island<br>
        I really like it<br>
        Coconut sunscreen, we swim<br>
        In the ocean<br>
        Our bodies covered in salt<br>
        Oh sunlit skies, make me feel less alone

        <br><br><br><br>

        <b>Homepage</b><br>
        (M. Blancaflor)<br><br>
        Hi, and welcome to the Internet.<br>
        Follow me, and I will be your compass!<br>
        You can do so many things online<br>
        Follow your interests, hear what people are talking about<br>
        Join the conversation<br>
        Navigating the cyberspace can be difficult<br>
        But I will help you along the way<br>
        So, let’s go surfing, and see what’s happening around the world

        <br><br><br><br>

        <b>Pipeline</b><br>
        (M. Blancaflor)<br><br>
        worldwide, everybodys loggin on for the weekend (ooh can you believe it)<br>
        and oh my, everybody wants to be your secret (ooh can you keep it)<br>
        and everybody wants to lend you a hand<br>
        but nobody would understand (if they could get it)<br>
        that you wanna run away from your night<br>
        and maybe go into reality and have a good time, but nevermind<br><br>

        look, i cant be alone<br>
        with the thoughts in my head<br>
        ever ever again<br>
        so, i go on my phone<br>
        for no particular reason<br>
        but i feel good again<br>
        oh no, i cant even think<br>
        on my own anymore<br>
        maybe twitter understands<br>
        well, i know its a problem<br>
        but what can i do<br>
        im just a simple man<br><br>

        self doubting my confidence<br>
        somedays feel marvelous<br>
        but other days i be off of it<br>
        my body so incompetent<br>
        i wanna look like you<br>
        talk and walk as tall as you<br>
        i wanna be like you, always having a good time<br><br>

        i feel like im missing everything<br>
        and hiding personality<br>
        i wanna be, i wanna be (yeah yeah yeah yeah)<br>
        when you're talking in your sleep<br>
        staying online<br>
        baby you and me, paradise<br>
        aint no place like you, yeah

        <br><br><br><br>

        <b>Orangutan</b><br>
        (M. Blancaflor)<br><br>
        yo, 808 388<br>
        if u want the rest call me later<br>
        I don't wanna be late to my class<br>
        gotta get my books gotta study my ass<br>
        off get a wage get a job<br>
        I don't speak broke u don't have airpods?<br>
        hmmmmmmm sowwy that was rude<br>
        this is what I'll do<br><br>

        I'm not gonna roast you that'd be pretty rude<br>
        matter fact I like u ur kinda cool<br><br>

        gimme whole wheat toast and oats<br>
        I don't like white bread it just taste like cockaroach<br>
        peanut butter jelly but no palm oil<br>
        i stan orangutans, king they royalty<br><br>

        gotta save them tho, save them tho<br>
        stop chopping down trees like dominoes<br>
        gotta save them tho, save them tho<br>
        they endangered, stop hurtin my bros<br><br>

        My name is orangutan king, you don’t gotta cut down tree<br>
        Please save me maybe we can make a plea<br><br>

        The endangerment of orangutans... the kings and queens of southeast asia. And we chop down their trees, and for what?! Some palm oil so we don’t have to stir our own god damn peanut butter? What a shame. I mean these animals, these beautiful animals, just look at them!

        <br><br><br><br>

        my mind is so vacant<br>
        no time contemplation<br>

        they don't need your love they want your att-<br><br>

        time is money and they gon get it, they gon get it<br><br>

        maybe you should take time off it<br>
        lately in the corner lonely sobbin more often<br>
        wishin you was this and wishin that you were that<br>
        butcha never thought maybe be yourself more often<br>
        im exhausted, talkin with yo thumbs not your lips<br>

        distance we keep it up but I really really miss u<br>
        bomb gonna detonate <br>

        I look through my timeline<br>
        Waiting for something exciting<br>
        And I waste, and i waste, all of my time<br>
        Wasting, I’m wasting, all of my time<br><br>

        Im not real to you anymore if you’re not tapping through my story<br>
        Thumbs on the right side of your phone again<br>
        Waiting for something exciting again

        <br><br><br><br>

        <b>Not Real</b><br>
        (M. Blancaflor)<br><br>
        I’m not real to you<br>
        I’m not real to you anymore<br><br>

        i thought i would see you more<br>
        im sitting cross crossed singin on a hardwood floor about<br>
        running around in the parking lot<br>
        of the old kmart just down the block<br>
        when we would, sit down in a beat up car<br>
        and talk and talk and talk<br>
        Talk and talk and talk<br><br>

        And I wanna be right there with you, but I can’t be<br>
        With you but i can’t be, with you<br><br>

        You think you friends hate
        You know your friends love
        You think you friends hate
        You know your friends love
        You think you friends hate
        You know your friends love
        You think you friends hate
        You know your friends love
        You know your friends love
        You know your friends love
        You know your friends love
        You know your friends love


        <br><br><br><br>

        <b>How's the View</b><br>
        (M. Blancaflor)<br><br>
        there's a lot to find in the little things<br>
        every winter night you cried<br>
        its alright, take your time<br>
        its alright, just take your time<br><br>

        when you're flying through the clouds<br>
        and your friends are on the ground<br>
        see them from an airplane window, how’s the view<br>
        from the window, how’s the view<br>
        from the window, thoughts of you<br>
        from the window, thoughts of you <br><br>

        a passive mind makes passive lives<br>
        your in my life<br>
        i dont wanna die<br>
        a passive mind makes passive lives<br>
        your in my mind<br>
        i dont wanna die<br><br>

        if theres light theres a shadow<br>
        follow me around where ever i go<br>
        but that shits behind me<br>
        when you play the piano<br>
        follow the sound wherever it goes<br>
        feel my skin and then you'll know<br><br>

        I’m real to me and that’s all i need<br>
        I’m real to me and that’s all i need<br>

        you'll be gone but not for long<br>
        they'll be waiting there for you<br>
        even though some-things will  change<br>
        the ocean remains<br>
        the ocean remains<br>
        the ocean remains


        <br><br><br><br>

        <b>Satellite Symphony</b><br>
        (M. Blancaflor)<br><br>
        close your eyes and feel the ground with ya<br>
        close your eyes and let the speckles flow<br>
        close your eyes and focus on the picture<br>
        close your eyes and let the feeling flow<br>
        close your eyes and take a break<br>
        I know you need it tho<br>
        just close your eyes and listen<br><br>

        You’re not alone, my<br>

        and you're not alone anymore
